        <p>As part of a team of four, I contributed to the development of a mobile campus navigation app designed to help students efficiently navigate the University of Nevada, 
            Reno campus. This app allows users to view the campus map and generate personalized routes based on their current location and desired destination. Routes can be 
            customized based on the user's preferred brightness level, which can be adjusted in the settings.. Additionally, users can place Safety Pins on the map, which 
            notify others about specific safety concerns or issues on campus. My main role involved working on the database aspect of the app, where we managed data related to 
            user roles, safety pins placed on the campus map, and nodes of light data collected throughout the campus.</p>

        <p>I developed a fitness journal web application that enables users to track progress, set weight goals, document exercises, and monitor nutritional intake. 
            The application includes a user authentication system with secure account creation, password confirmation, and login validation, ensuring that user credentials 
            are verified against stored database records. The web application was built using Flask and integrates a PostgreSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval. 
            Using Psycopg2, I ensured seamless communication between the web application and the database, allowing users to access and update their personalized fitness data in real time. </p>

        <h2>NBA Offensive Statistical Dashboard</h2>
        <div>
            <img src="img/Dashboard Screenshot.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>For this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of evolving offensive trends in the NBA over the past 20 seasons. 
            The focus was on examining how playing styles have changed, including the impact of the three-point shot, the perception of a "softer" NBA, 
            and the decline in defensive play. I used web scraping techniques to gather the necessary data with BeautifulSoup and Requests to 
            scrape 20 tables of data from Basketball-Reference for each NBA season. The scraped data, which included league averages for NBA offenses, was stored in a 
            Pandas DataFrame for further processing. I then visualized the findings using Power BI, creating a dashboard that presented the trends and allowed for 
            comparative analysis of offensive statistics over the years. This project provided valuable insights into how the NBA's offensive strategies and overall gameplay 
            have evolved over the past two decades.</p>

        <div>
            <img src="img/Nfl_graphs.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <p>I scraped offensive statistics for all 32 NFL teams spanning from 2013 to 2023, conducting an in-depth analysis of offensive trends, 
            correlations, and team comparisons to derive actionable insights. I obtained the data from the NFL website using BeautifulSoup and Requests, 
            successfully extracting 22 tables of data—11 for passing statistics and 11 for rushing statistics—covering the entire 11-year period.       
            To store and process the data efficiently, I used Pandas to organize it into structured DataFrames. I then used Matplotlib to visualize key trends, 
            making it easier to compare team performances and identify correlations between offensive metrics. My analyses included examining offensive trends from 2013 to 2023, 
            identifying relationships between key statistics, comparing team performances over time, and validating common narratives such as whether the NFL has evolved 
            into a pass-first league and if offensive production has declined in recent years.</p>

        <p>This project is a game search tool that scrapes data from MobyGames to retrieve information on Nintendo Switch game titles. Using web scraping techniques with BeautifulSoup, 
            it collects game details from multiple pages of the website. The project then processes and cleans the data to ensure accuracy. To enable efficient game search 
            functionality, a similarity score is utilized to compare user queries with the game titles. This approach helps retrieve the most relevant game results based on 
            textual similarity.</p>
